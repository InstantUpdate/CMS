**[Instant Update][3] is free Open Source PHP/MySQL Content Management System (CMS).** 

The Difference from others
--------------

Instant Update is based on NO template structure. **Your HTML is your template.** 

As HTML elements may have unique ID attribute set, our choice was to use HTML IDs to mark editable regions. This is all done on the fly. That means that Instant Update recognizes all IDs automatically.

2. Gallery that works similar to repeatable content only with images.
 
3. Plugin system.
 
4. Contact form plugin.

5. Improved statistics.
